#### Linux CLI
- almost all commands were new for me
- when I start to do this task, I start to use the command from the https://linuxsurvival.com. So it's pretty useful things for me
- I will continue to use this knowledge in my job and on this course

#### HTTP 
Need to remember 4 main requests:
- GET
- PUT
- POST
- DELETE

Need to remember the status code for to understand on which side and where it might be a problem:
- 1xx: Informational Messages
- 2xx: Successful
- 3xx: Redirection
- 4xx: Client Error
- 5xx: Server Error

- All connections have different security: http and https.
- Cash has many different values, which responsible for expiration of the document, cash-control (what we need to show to the client)
